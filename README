# AutoSlideNetCheck Setup Guide

This guide provides a complete setup for running the **AutoSlideNetCheck** script on a Mac with a fresh installation of macOS Sequoia. This setup is ideal for an office or display device that should automatically log in, run a Google Slides presentation in full-screen mode, and check for internet connectivity.


## Requirements
- A Mac running macOS Sequoia.
- User account **"Office TV"** for the display machine.
- Google Chrome installed (assumed included in the JAMF profile).

## Installation



### 1. Run the Installation Script (Recommended)



To streamline the setup process, use the provided installation script. This script automates configuration steps like scheduling power on/off times, enabling auto-login, setting notifications, and adding the AutoSlideNetCheck script as a login item.

**Script:** [install_auto_slide.sh](install_auto_slide.sh)



#### Run the script:

1. Save the script on your Mac, naming it `install_auto_slide.sh`.
2. Make the script executable by opening a terminal and running:

chmod +x install_auto_slide.sh

Run the script with sudo privileges:

sudo ./install_auto_slide.sh



The script will automatically:

Schedule power on/off for weekdays (7:30 AM on, 4:00 PM off).
Set up auto-login for the Office TV user.
Disable notifications and configure Do Not Disturb hours.
Add AutoSlideNetCheck as a login item.
Configure Energy Saver settings and lock certain System Preferences.




2. Manual Configuration Steps (In Case of Script Errors)



### 1. Perform a Clean Install of macOS
   - Wipe the Mac and perform a fresh installation of **macOS Sequoia**.

### 2. Set Up Initial Admin Account
   - Create an admin account named **Office TV** with a secure password for setup purposes.

### 3. Configure Auto-Login for Office TV
   - Go to **System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options**.
   - Enable auto-login for **Office TV**.

Troubleshooting
